# India Air Quality Data Visualization Using Tableau

- In this project I am using Tableau Dekstop for visualization on India Air Quality Data.

## Tableau Dashboard URL :: 

- https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rohit.bhavsar3097/viz/Week7-Task7/Dashboard2?publish=yes

## Objective ::

- I have attempted to use Tableau for data visualization, and dashboarding.My goal in creating this visualization is to test my tableau visualization abilities and to share my work with others in hopes of inspiring others with visualization ideas.

## Dataset Information ::

- Under the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP), the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the Central Pollution Control Board of India produced Historical Daily Ambient Air Quality Data, which is aggregated (across the years and states) and generally clean.

- The dataset contains various columns related to environmental data. Here are some key columns in the dataset:

1. stn_code: Station code
2. sampling_date: Date when the sample was taken
3. state: Name of the state
4. location: Location name
5. agency: Agency name
6. type: Type of area (e.g., Residential, Industrial)
7. so2: Sulphur dioxide level
8. no2: Nitrogen dioxide level
9. rspm: Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter
10. spm: Suspended Particulate Matter
11. location_monitoring_station: Location of the monitoring station
12. pm2_5: Particulate matter 2.5
13. date: Date in a different format

## Data Cleaning ::

- Although I have done some basic cleaning with the datasetâ€”such as renaming column name Area to Area Type and correcting the spelling of some cities and states it is ready for use and doesn't require any pre-processing before visualization. To make these changes, I followed the basic instructions in Tableau itself.

## Basic Knowledge Requirement about Air quality Parameters ::

- Among the most dangerous outdoor air pollutants are sulfur dioxide (So2) and nitrogen dioxide (No2).Because NO2 interacts with the immune system, being outside can raise the risk of respiratory tract infections.Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a factor in respiratory symptoms in patients without underlying lung illness as well as in healthy individuals.

- Vehicles, industries, and combustion processes all produce respirable suspended particulate matter, or RSPM.

## Potential Vizualization that can be shown on this Dataset ::

- Compare SO2 and NO2 levels from the initial years in the dataset

- Analyze the trends of SO2 and NO2 levels after the year 2000

- Show the increasing trend of average SPM levels across different states in India

- Identify the top 20 cities with the worst air quality based on average RSPM levels

- Categorize areas by the quality of air based on SO2 and NO2 levels

- Focus on the air quality in India's capital, specifically looking at SO2 and NO2 levels

- Create a scatter plot to explore correlations between different pollutants

- Create a graph showing the number of samples or pollution levels monitored by each agency
